The rise of online platforms has transformed the hospitality industry, with Airbnb emerging as a global leader in short-term rentals. Founded in 2008, the company enables hosts and guests to connect through a commission-based marketplace without owning listed properties.

This study analyzes Airbnb’s New York City dataset to derive insights into availability, pricing, and guest experience. Using data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization methods, the research highlights key factors influencing market dynamics. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of Airbnb’s role in urban accommodation and provide practical implications for stakeholders navigating the evolving short-term rental landscape.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to estimate Airbnb listing prices.
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to estimate Airbnb listing prices. Accurate pricing is essential for both hosts, who seek to maximize occupancy and revenue, and guests, who value fairness and affordability. By analyzing historical Airbnb data, the study applies regression techniques to uncover how factors such as location, property size, and guest ratings influence pricing. The resulting model supports more informed and data-driven pricing decisions for new or potential listings.
